# Analysis of Dr. Death's Crimes Using Power BI

## Introduction
This project utilises Microsoft Power BI to analyse and visualise the pattern of crimes committed by Harold Shipman, infamously known as Dr. Death, who was convicted of the murder of 15 of his patients, with a suspected total of 215 victims. The goal of this analysis is to provide a detailed overview of the victims' demographics and the timeline of the murders.

### What’s Power BI?
Imagine you have a big box of old photographs, documents, and notes about various topics. Each piece of paper or photograph tells you something interesting, but to really understand what's going on, you need to organise them. 

**Power BI** is like a magical table where you can spread out all these items. It helps you organise them neatly, find connections between them, and then display everything in a way that's easy to understand. It turns your box of mixed-up papers into a clear, colourful display, like a poster, where each piece of information is shown as a chart or graph.

### What is a Dashboard?
Think of a dashboard like your car’s dashboard. It shows you the most important information at a glance — how fast you’re going, how much fuel you have. A Power BI dashboard does something similar, but for your business or project. It shows you the key pieces of information from your data on one screen, so you can see what’s happening at a glance.

### Advantages and Disadvantages:
**Advantages:**
- **Easy Connection**: Similarly to how a puzzle is easier to solve when the pieces fit easily, Power BI makes it simple to bring different kinds of data together.
- **Always Up-to-Date**: It’s like having a newspaper that updates itself with the latest news throughout the day.
- **You Can Make It Your Own**: You can arrange the information just the way you like, making it easy to understand at a glance.

**Disadvantages:**
- **It can Be Tricky at First**: Learning to use Power BI is like learning to ride a bike. It might be a bit tricky at first, but once you get the hang of it, it becomes easier.
- **Not So Quick with Lots of Data**: If you try to put too many papers on your magical table at once, it might start to slow down.
- **Best with Other Microsoft Tools**: Power BI works best if you already use other tools from Microsoft, kind of like how some battery brands work best with certain gadgets.

### Key Features:
- **Drag-and-Drop**: Imagine being able to move your photographs around on a board with just your fingertips. That's what drag-and-drop is — moving things around on your screen easily to organise them.
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**: This is like having a smarter calculator that helps you find out exactly what you need from your data.
- **Power Query**: Consider this to be a super-efficient filing system that helps you get your data neat and ready for use.

### Types of Visualisations:
Imagine if instead of telling someone how many apples and oranges you have, you could just show them a picture with colourful bars or lines representing each fruit — that’s what these visualisations are. They make it easier to see and understand differences and patterns, like comparing how many apples you sold in June versus July.

## Data Context
The data includes confirmed and estimated death counts spanning from 1975 to 1998. It was structured around various parameters, such as the age, gender, time of death, and location of death of the victims. This comprehensive dataset allowed for a multidimensional analysis of the patterns that could have hinted at the sinister nature of Dr. Death's activities much earlier.

## Power BI Dashboard
The dashboard designed in Power BI offers interactive visualisations that highlight key aspects of the crime data:
- **Yearly Distribution of Deaths**: Showcases the number of deaths per year, highlighting the peak murder years.
- **Victim Demographics**: Breaks down the victims by age and gender, revealing a significant skew toward older female victims.
- **Time Analysis**: Provides insights into the times of day the deaths occurred, which could indicate patterns in the perpetrator’s operations.
- **Geographical Analysis**: Maps the locations where the crimes were most frequently committed, pointing to strategic choices by Dr. Death.

## Analysis Findings
Our analysis confirms that the majority of the victims were elderly women, primarily aged between 75 and 84. The deadliest years were 1997, followed closely by 1995 and 1996. A significant number of the murders were committed during the early hours, suggesting a methodical approach to the crimes.

## Conclusion
The data analysis through Power BI provided profound insights into the modus operandi of Harold Shipman. The ability to visualise complex datasets with such tools underlines the importance of data analytics in forensic investigations to potentially prevent future crimes.

### Data Analytics in Crime Investigation

#### Overview
Data analytics has become a transformative tool in the field of crime investigation. Leveraging large volumes of data and advanced analytical techniques, law enforcement agencies can uncover patterns and insights that were previously obscured or too complex to decipher manually. The integration of technology in forensic investigations enhances the accuracy of the outcomes and accelerates the process, enabling quicker resolutions to cases.

#### Modern Technologies Used in Forensic Investigations

##### 1. **Big Data Analytics**
Big data technologies enable the handling and analysis of vast amounts of data generated from various sources such as surveillance videos, mobile records, GPS data, and social media. By applying big data analytics, investigators can identify patterns and relationships in data, such as common locations, times, or other contextual details related to crimes.

##### 2. **Machine Learning and AI**
Machine learning algorithms can predict potential crime hotspots and likely times for crimes to occur, based on historical data. AI enhances facial recognition systems, voice recognition, and even predictive policing. These systems learn from new data inputs continuously, thereby improving their accuracy and reliability in real-time crime prediction and investigation.

##### 3. **Geospatial Analysis**
Geospatial technologies involve mapping and analysing the geographical locations associated with crime scenes. This can help law enforcement agencies in understanding spatial patterns of crimes, optimising patrol routes, and placing resources in areas with higher crime rates.

##### 4. **Digital Forensics**
This involves the recovery and investigation of material found in digital devices, often crucial in solving cybercrimes such as hacking, identity theft, and unauthorised data breaches. Digital forensics can also play a pivotal role in more traditional crimes, where digital devices may contain critical evidence such as communications and timelines.

##### 5. **Network Analysis**
Network analysis tools are used to explore relationships and interactions between individuals, identifying potential criminal networks and hierarchies. This is particularly useful in cases involving organised crime, trafficking, and corruption.

#### Benefits of Data Analytics in Crime Investigation

- **Efficiency**: Automated tools and AI-driven systems can process and analyse data much faster than manual methods, leading to quicker investigative processes.
- **Accuracy**: Data analytics minimises human errors and biases, providing more accurate insights and leads based on empirical data.
- **Proactivity**: Predictive analytics enable law enforcement agencies to operate proactively rather than reactively, potentially preventing crimes before they occur.
- **Resource Allocation**: Insight from data helps in optimal allocation of resources, ensuring that personnel and technological resources are utilised where they are most needed.

#### Challenges and Considerations

While data analytics offers numerous advantages, it also comes with challenges such as privacy concerns, the need for proper data governance, and the potential for data bias which can lead to ethical and legal issues. Ensuring the integrity and security of data is paramount to maintaining public trust in law enforcement practices.

#### Conclusion

The integration of data analytics into crime investigation heralds a new era of policing and forensic science. As technology advances, the capabilities of law enforcement will continue to evolve, making crime solving more sophisticated and comprehensive. This progression enhances the effectiveness of criminal investigations and supports the broader goals of public safety and security.
