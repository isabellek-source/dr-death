## What’s Power BI?

Imagine you have a big box of old photographs, documents, and notes about various topics.
Each piece of paper or photograph tells you something interesting, but to really understand
what's going on, you need to organise them.
Power BI is like a magical table where you can spread out all these items. It helps you organise
them neatly, find connections between them, and then display everything in a way that's easy to
understand. It turns your box of mixed-up papers into a clear, colourful display, like a poster,
where each piece of information is shown as a chart or graph.

## What is a Dashboard?

Think of a dashboard like your car’s dashboard. It shows you the most important information
at a glance — how fast you’re going, how much fuel you have. A Power BI dashboard does
something similar, but for your business or project. It shows you the key pieces of information
from your data on one screen, so you can see what’s happening at a glance.

## Advantages and Disadvantages:

*Advantages:*

- Easy Connection: Similarly to how a puzzle is easier to solve when the pieces fit
easily, Power BI makes it simple to bring different kinds of data together.
- Always Up-to-Date: It’s like having a newspaper that updates itself with the latest
news throughout the day.
- You Can Make It Your Own: You can arrange the information just the way you
like, making it easy to understand at a glance.

*Disadvantages:*

- It can Be Tricky at First: Learning to use Power BI is like learning to ride a bike. It
might be a bit tricky at first, but once you get the hang of it, it becomes easier.
- Not So Quick with Lots of Data: If you try to put too many papers on your
magical table at once, it might start to slow down.
- Best with Other Microsoft Tools: Power BI works best if you already use other
tools from Microsoft, kind of like how some battery brands work best with certain
gadgets.

## Key Features:

- Drag-and-Drop: Imagine being able to move your photographs around on a board
with just your fingertips. That's what drag-and-drop is — moving things around on
your screen easily to organise them.
- DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): This is like having a smarter calculator that
helps you find out exactly what you need from your data.
- Power Query: Consider this to be a super-efficient filing system that helps you get
your data neat and ready for use.

## Types of Visualisations:

Imagine if instead of telling someone how many apples and oranges you have, you could just
show them a picture with colourful bars or lines representing each fruit — that’s what these
visualisations are. They make it easier to see and understand differences and patterns, like
comparing how many apples you sold in June versus July.
